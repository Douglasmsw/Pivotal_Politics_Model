# Pivotal_Politics_Model

This was my first personal project when I was first learning how to work with CSV data. I wanted to learn how to use Matplotlib and thought it would be fun to automate something from class: The Pivotal Politics Model.

It is too obnoxious to explain here so for a breakdown on how it works visit here: https://spia.uga.edu/faculty_pages/dougherk/tpc_pivotal_politics_lecture.pdf 

Using DW-Nominate Score data I created a tool that allows you to select either the U.S. House of Representatives or Senate from any congressional term as well as the president (if multiple presided over the body) and then input a status quo ideological point and generate the pivotal politics figure. This figure is an approximation of what will happen to legislation on this issue as it is negotiated over time and vetoed / filibustered. 

If you are curious about it feel free to play with the Jupyter Notebook. This was my first project so the code is messy but I figure I should put where I started in here so I can look back and feel proud!
